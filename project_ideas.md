## Manage landing page
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5 </br>
This landing page will give your CSS skills a nice test. There are some background patterns that need to be positioned accurately and some little details in the switch from desktop to mobile. There are also a few areas that will require some JS.
### Brief
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign-up form is submitted if:
-- The input field is empty
-- The email address is not formatted correctly
### Learning Outcomes
Your major takeaways from this challenge will be related to CSS and layout. If you haven't done so by now, you might want to try out a pre-processor, like Sass, to help keep your code maintainable.

## Job listings with filtering
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt </br>
Now that you've got a bit more comfortable with JavaScript, let's practice some filtering. In this challenge, you'll need to filter the job listings by the categories selected. There are two options to choose from for how to approach it:
- *Option 1:* Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML data- attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the index.html file.
- *Option 2:* Use the local data.json file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
### Brief
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories selected
### Learning Outcomes
You'll learn how to use JavaScript to filter items in the DOM. This is a key skill when building client-side applications, so this challenge will be great practice!
